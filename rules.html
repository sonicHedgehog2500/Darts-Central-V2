								<div class="collapse-item-body">
									<h1>is it possible to score more than 180 points in a single turn?</h1>
									<p>
										Scoring more than 180 points is not possible even in a single turn. The highest 
										value / segment on a dartboard is 20 with its triple value equaling 60. Since a 
										player has 3 darts, the highest value they can score in a single turn is 
										3 x 3 x 20 = 180 points.

								<div class="collapse-item-body">
									<h1>if a player throws a dart but does not go in the board, can they retake the throw?</h1>
									<p>
										Any thrown darts missing the dartboard or not hitting a segment counts as 0 points
										and cannot be re-thrown. During a player's turn, any thrown darts which fall off 
										the board before completing your turn / collecting your darts cannot be re-thrown 
										and count as 0 points. But, any darts that fall out your hand before being thrown 
										can be re-thrown.
